# AirbnbChallenge
In this challenge, you are supposed to predict prices of Airbnb listings in New York City. A dataset with 49,076 such listings is being provided. Remember to do some basic data cleaning first. Then, apply a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to (cluster and) predict prices. What are the most relevant features for price prediction? Based on your analysis, what would be your recommendations to both Airbnb and to the owners of the properties?
